# Pathfinder_WotR_Char_Randomization-Script  
  

  This is a Script to generate a Random Character for Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous  


## How to Use  
First, ensure the [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer is installed  
Then, start the main.py file  

# On Windows  
  
To be honest, not sure, i guess you can doubleclick the file as long as Windows associates .py files with Python3?  
  
# Ubuntu  

Open the Terminal in the Folder with the Script and enter the following  
    python3 main.py
